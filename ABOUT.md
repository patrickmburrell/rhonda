# About Rhonda

## The Name

**Rhonda** is named after the Beach Boys' 1965 classic hit **"Help Me, Rhonda"**.

Just like in the song where the protagonist asks Rhonda for help getting over his troubles, this tool helps Delivery Leads get over the trouble of tracking repository activity and generating status reports!

## Why "Rhonda"?

1. **Memorable** - Everyone knows the song, making the tool name easy to remember
2. **Friendly** - "Rhonda" sounds approachable and helpful, not corporate or technical
3. **Alliteration** - "Rhonda Repos" and "Rhonda Report" roll off the tongue nicely
4. **Purpose** - The song's theme of asking for help perfectly captures what the tool does

## The Tagline

**"Help me, Rhonda!"** - Your friendly repository report generator.

## Fun Facts

- "Help Me, Rhonda" reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1965
- The song was written by Brian Wilson and Mike Love
- It's one of the Beach Boys' most recognizable hits
- The original album version was titled "Help Me, Ronda" (one 'h')

## Using Rhonda

Every time your wife runs `./bin/rhonda-report.sh`, she'll see:

```
🎵 Help me, Rhonda... generating your report! 🎵
```

Because everyone needs a little help with their repository reports!
